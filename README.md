# QuickSim for SiQAD

QuickSim is an accurate *and* efficient physical simulation algorithm for determining the charge distribution of atomic *Silicon Dangling Bond (SiDB)* assemblies.
Since positively charged SiDBs are not yet used for logic, this algorithm is a 2-state simulation and neglects positively charged SiDBs, which is a reasonable assumption for SiDB assemblies without adjacent SiDBs.
